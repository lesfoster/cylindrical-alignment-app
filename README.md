The Cylindrical Alignment App is a port / rewrite, from Java3D to JavaFX, and will utilize the NetBeans framework rather than the homegrown Swing infrastructure in place earlier.  The former name of this application was "Cylindrical BLAST Viewer".  However, any thing alignmenable can be presented using this project (BLAST, gene calls, ClustalW output, and even Microsoft Project files).

### What is this repository for? ###
