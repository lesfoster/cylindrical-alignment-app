This file was created as a ClustalW output file, by Dr. David Landsman.  It was subsequently converted programmatically by a utility
to the Cylinder XML format.

With proper classpath setup:

	Java CylindricalBlastViewer samples\h4_muscle_histones\h4_muscle.cyl.xml 4

Or, using the distributed jar file:

	java -jar dist\cylindrical_viewer-V.R-dev.jar samples\h4_muscle_histones\h4_muscle.cyl.xml 4

(Here, V and R are the Version and Revision of the release.)
Please remember, that in all cases, you need to first install Java3d 1.3.1 prior to attempting to run any sample.
