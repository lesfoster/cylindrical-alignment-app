These files originated on http://genome.nhgri.nih.gov/genemachine/, and were generated by that web site, in response to
"unknown" sequences (academic exercises--perhaps the instructor knew what they were?).  The output was then put through
a conversion from the ASN.1 to an XML format, and then converted again into the Cylinder xml format.

With proper setup of classpath:

	java CylindricalBlastViewer samples\gene_machine\gene_machine_2.cyl.xml 0

or, from the executable jar in dist, first change to the Cylindrical_Blast_Viewer directory, and:

	java -jar dist\cylindrical_viewer-V.R-rlse.jar samples\gene_machine\gene_machine_2.cyl.xml 0

(here, V.R is the version and revision of the release, such as 1.1).

Please remember, that in all cases, you need to first install Java3d 1.3.1 prior to attempting to run any sample.
