Progress of Development: The Cylindrical Alignment App

Background:
This is a refactoring/porting from Java3D to JavaFX, of the Cylindrical BLAST
Viewer.  It will leverage NetBeans platform, for event routing between major
views and subviews, and will be an attempt at fixing some of the deployment and
environment problems which plague the Java3D implementation from 2005.

borrowed some aspects of the Molecule Sample App from Oracle.

- Need to pull down, from old system, the following:
* legend_model package.
* data_source package.

4/14/2015 - Have at least setup code to place entire cylinder, axis glyph and
label onto the screen.  Positioning is completely wrong.  Needs debug.  Have
completed pulldown of data source.
